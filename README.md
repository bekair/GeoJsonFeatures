# GeoJsonFeatures
Get GeoJson feature of a coordinate with the help of OpenStreetMapApi

The application can make API calls for retrieving the features in a bounding box from http://openstreetmap.org/api/0.6 API. It gives me an osm formatted file. The conversion is made by osmtogeojson.js (https://github.com/tyrasd/osmtogeojson) library. It can be parsed into the GeoJsonFeatures list with the help of this little helper js. I made the OpenStreetMap API call from my WebApi project. The WebApi calls from the Web UI of the solution could have been made directly but I preferred to call with HttpClient. Some problem that I have determined in the OpenStreetMap API caused not to set me up the edge case values of min_lon, min_lat, max_lon, and max_lat values. The API returns the 'The parameter bbox is required and must be of the form min_lon,min_lat,max_lon,max_lat.' message when I make the 'http://openstreetmap.org/api/0.6/map' request so I need to add parameters in 'http://openstreetmap.org/api/0.6/map?bbox=20,10,10,90' this format. According to the first message, the parameters should 'min_lon: 20, min_lat: 10, max_lon: 10, max_lon: 90' in the second request; but when I send the request, It sends me back 'The latitudes must be between -90 and 90, longitudes between -180 and 180 and the minima must be less than the maxima.' error. My brain was confused a little bit about this structure.
